#+title: Alfred

A way to think about personal finance with ledger and ledger-mode for emacs.

* What does Alfred do?
Alfred makes it much easier to keep track of your finances using ledger in emacs. It allows you to quickly insert expenses into your ledger while automatically keeping track of you budget and savings.
Also supports 2 currencies, maybe more?
